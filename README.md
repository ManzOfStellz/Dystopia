# Dystopia
Neat little game I made in my free time

Made in Python 3

Made in repl, runs best in repl.

Please do not alter the datastore file in any way before use, doing *may* lead to issues later on in the game

Multiple endings

How to run:
Three methods

Method 1:
Go to: https://replit.com/@ManzOfStellz/Dystopia#README.md 
Fork and run

Method 2:
Download, upload to repl, and run

Method 3:
Download as zip, extract all files to the same folder, open main.py in editor and F5

Made by me (ManzOfStellz) -- some basic functions used such as slowprint can be found on many other sites too -- and of course I had to do my research into handling xml files, so I did use stackoverflow for figuring out how to manipulate the datastore.
